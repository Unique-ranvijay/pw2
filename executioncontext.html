<!-- Execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It consists of various components that determine how the code is executed and how it interacts with variables, functions, and other elements in the program. Understanding the execution context is crucial for understanding how code is interpreted and executed by a programming language. -->
<script> 
var x = 10;

function foo(y) {
  var z = x + y;
  return z;
}

var result = foo(5);
console.log(result);
